This is a collection of all the regression techniques from class. In addition to these mini-assignments, we also completed independed and group projects (lables **projects**). 

The goals of this folder is to keep a list of my work from that class as a refrence so as I expand my knowledge I can modify and add to this collection. 

**Methods Used in R:**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Multiple Linear Regression 
3. Logistic Regression Model 
4. K Nearest Neighbors 
5. Factor Selection 
6. Classification Trees 
7. Regression Trees
