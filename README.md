# Applied-Data-Science-in-R
A collection of mini projects in R that apply statistical and machine learning methods and tools to solve data-driven problems

Day 1: I am applying some of the methods learned in class and using them to look at some datasets of interest. The datasets I am using (and that I am interested in)  are in the **datasets folder**

Day 0: In my Applied Data Science class we practiced using different statistical and machine learning methods on simple datasets (like Iris and the Titanic ) This work can be see under the **class folder**  However I am still curious about these metods.
